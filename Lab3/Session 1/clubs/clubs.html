    <h1>Clubs</h1>
    <h1>Artrigour (The Art Club)</h1>
    <p>
      Our proposal is something to allow students to freely express themselves
      without the harsh judgments of society. We are willing to provide the
      students with a platform to communicate their ideas through ART. <br />
      <br />
      Since our day to day life is already so hectic and strenuous, we aim to
      allow them to freely vent out their emotions and feelings on a piece of
      paper. <br />
      <br />
      As they say, computer science is the amalgamation of a bit of coding and
      massive creating. <br />
      <br />
      So, why not take a step towards enhancing our already creative minds and
      give it a stir! <br />
      <br />
      Why not make an initiative to fill the parched canvas of our mundane life
      with some colors.
